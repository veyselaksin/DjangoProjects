                    Hello, I'm Veysel AKSƒ∞N. Back ‚Äì End Developer üßë‚Äçüíª. I live in Istanbul.
                    I am developing data Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Chatbot applications at the beginner level, with a focus on web projects.
                    Every developer has a main language. My main language has evolved from Java to Python.
                    I think that writing easy and useful scripts is the biggest factor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from Yozgat Bozok University - Computer Engineering as a
                    honored student. I‚Äôm Back-End Developer with half a year's of experience as
                    a professional title. I'm blogging new posts and publish to people what I
                    learned.

                <h5>About Me</h5>
                <p>
                    I was born in 1999 in Mardin. Shortly after my birth, my family migrated to Istanbul, so I am also
                    emigrated üê¶.
                    After graduating from Kocasinan ≈ûehit Samet Kƒ±rba≈ü Vocational Technical and Anatolian High School in
                    2017, I started to study at
                    Yozgat Bozok University Computer Engineering, located in the desolate land of Yozgat. I made good
                    friends here and I think it was
                    the best time of my student years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of my day is spent with Python. I write various libraries and plugins with Python. As a former
                    Javan I think I betrayed Java,
                    forgive me Java ü•≤
                    Finally, don't forget to follow me on my social media accounts. Good reading!

                <h5>What I Interest?</h5>
                <p>
                    When I was a student, I focused on improving myself. I worked in various communities. I specialized
                    in OOP, Rest API, Clean Code,
                    SQL and NoSQL, Django. I support people by writing various Python libraries.
                    After completing my voluntary and compulsory internship in Robotistan for 4 months, I started to
                    work as a Back - End Developer in the
                    same company. I have developed and continue to develop applications in different fields for
                    Robotistan company.
                    The biggest of these is software called RFM. Web Scraping and Data Visualization, Sales forecasting
                    applications are also
                    included in the application as plugins integrated with RFM.
